# kickstarter-anlaysis
An analysis of Kickstarter campaigns
Specific to performing analysis for Louise's Kickstarter campaigns.
## Errors in Process
Please note that in 'Descrip Stat' sheet, all outputs are sound in logic---yet do not match the class lesson outputs 
This 'Error' is either drawn from a filtering issue or simple function issues when using--- =average, =median, =quartile.exc, etc. 
### Recommendations
Based off the analysis I hold these three suggestions
* A. Category Stats--- We found that by filtering by theater and subcategory plays, we had nearly 349 failed vs 525 successful--- In GB there were 89 failed vs 258 successful---Louise should focus on GB.
* B. Descriptive Stats--- Based off our numbers we saw the IQR (goal) is nearly 60% of the mean (successful) and 20% of the mean (failed). In general we found the pledged had an IQR of $6000+ and failed when $72,000+ 
* c. Box Plot---we can see the Q1, Lower quartile at the bottom of the X axis. We recommend Louise spend at most $4000 euros, and stay closer to the $2000 euro range
